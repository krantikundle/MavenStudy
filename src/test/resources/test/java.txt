In java every variable and every expression has some type 
each and every data type is clearly defined
every assignment should be checked by compiler for type compatibility.
because of above reasons we can conclude Java language is strongly typed programming lang.


java is not considered as pure object oriented programming language.
because several oops feature are not supported by java like opearator overloading and mutiple inheritance etc
moreover we are depending on primitive data types which are non-objects.

except boolean and char remaining data types are considered as signed data types because we can represent both
positive and negative numbers.
